# OOP-Vs-Functional-Paradigm
This repository offers a comprehensive framework for benchmarking a range of algorithms implemented across multiple programming languages, with a focus on comparing performance between Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) approaches. By examining each approachâ€™s efficiency and responsiveness under varying conditions, this project highlights the strengths and trade-offs of OOP and FP paradigms, providing insights into the most effective use cases for each.
